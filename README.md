# 📚 Data Structures Repo 📚
Welcome to my Data Structures Repo! This repository is a collection of data structure implementations that I have created to improve my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **arrays** : Implementation of various operations on arrays.
- **linked-lists** : Implementation of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
- **stacks** : Implementation of stack data structure and various operations on stack.
- **queues** : Implementation of queue data structure and various operations on queue.
- **trees** : Implementation of binary search tree, AVL tree, and various tree traversal algorithms.
