# 📚 Data Structures Repo 📚
Welcome to my Data Structures Repo! This repository is a collection of data structure implementations that I have created to improve my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

##📂 Folder Structure
arrays : Implementation of various operations on arrays.
linked-lists : Implementation of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
stacks : Implementation of stack data structure and various operations on stack.
queues : Implementation of queue data structure and various operations on queue.
trees : Implementation of binary search tree, AVL tree, and various tree traversal algorithms.
hash-tables : Implementation of hash tables using chaining and linear probing.
graphs : Implementation of graph data structure and various graph traversal algorithms.
sorting-algorithms : Implementation of popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
🚀 Getting Started
